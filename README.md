## The Getaway Car

This is a small game written in python using the pygame library. The goal is to dodge as many obstacles(they were police cars in another parallel universe) as possible without going out of bounds. The speed of the obstacles increases as each one of them is dodged.

Play the game by typing: `python3 the_getaway_car.py`
It needs pygame library, so go ahead and install it with `pip3 install pygame`
